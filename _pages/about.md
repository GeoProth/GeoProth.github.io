I’m Geoff. I live in Salt Lake City and recently graduated from Weber State University while studying Computer Science.  
I love challenges, love solving them in code even more, and am eager to work on web and software projects to help kick off my career.

I’m looking for work. The best way to reach me is through email or Linked In
