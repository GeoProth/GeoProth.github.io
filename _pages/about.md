I recently graduated from Weber State University with a Bachelors of Computer Science.
While studying at Weber I was able to take part in some great team projects and utilize my technical skillset and positive attitude
to help drive our teams over the finish line with awesome results.  I am a friendly people person that loves to program and
seek out new challenging opportunites to build on my technical skill sets.  I am a self motivated individual that strives to keep learning
and have fun doing it!

Before attending Weber State and aquiring my Computer Science degree, I had the opportunity to work for an amazing company
called Quality Bicycle Products.  I was an Outbound Lead and a Special Order Processor for 4 years.  During this time I took on many
roles and loved working with people.  As an Outbound Lead I was always looking for ways to improve our processes to help
our team be more efficient and always tried to keep others motivated and enjoy the work.
I loved the daily process of problem solving technical issues and working with a great team
to execute our processes in the most fun and efficient ways.

You can expect me to utilize my knowledge and positive attitude for driving successful project outcomes while being an
engaged and energetic team player. I seek out challenges with the eagerness of someone hungry for growth and am always
pushing to deliver the best version of myself as a team member.
