I'm currently a senior at Weber State University. 
As I have been pursuing my CS degree, I have experienced many frustrations and challenges, 
but met those hurdles with perseverence and have gained new knowledge, perspective, 
and more passion for the field of CS.  I still have much to learn, 
but have developed the frameworks necessary to build upon my skills. 


Below is a current list of my completed CS studies
